# portfolio-site
### No longer being worked on
I have moved/split this project into two seperate apps.
I initially planned to combine my portfolio admin site and main portfolio site into one, but felt it got too messy and the admin panel took no advantage of NextJS' features.
You can now find the admin panel here:

### https://github.com/domcattell/nextjs-portfolio

Built using NextJS, MongoDB, NodeJS and ExpressJS
